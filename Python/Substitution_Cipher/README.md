## Substitution Cipher

- The Substitution Cipher is a Cryptographic technique used for the encryption of a message
- The encryption is done based on a key agreed upon by the sender and receiver of the message
- The letter is encoded/mapped to a different letter/character

## Working

- The user is prompted to enter the message as well as the key according to which the message will be encrypted
- The key will be accepted as a CSV file
- Considering an example :
